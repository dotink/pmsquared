# PM² is a Package Manager for Package Managers

As web developers, we understand the uses of a good package manager.  Things like Composer and Bower have redefined our workflow and ensured we no longer again have to worry about using our version control systems as ways to ensure we can easily access specific versions of our code.  Never will our children have to worry about how on earth they will ensure their projects can cross-link and recursively pull from specific versions of their dependencies!

Unfortunately, the number of available package managers has skyrocketed.  Enter PM².

## FAQ

### The documentation and command output say PM² with a capital 'P', and 'M', why isn't the command capitalized?

We recognize that typing capital letters requires extra work for keyboardists.  We wanted to keep the command as simple to type as possible for speed.
